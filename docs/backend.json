    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support the SaudiDropship platform, focusing on product presentation and WhatsApp-based order placement.  The core principle is to maintain a flat, easily queryable product catalog. Categories are managed as a fixed list within the application code, not as a separate collection, to simplify management. User data is stored for potential future features, such as order history or account management, and follows a standard private data pattern. **Authorization Independence**: All authorization will happen in Firebase Authentication. Since no role-based authorization is requested, no denormalization is needed, as all read operations are public. If any administrative control is needed in the future, a new collection `/admins/{uid}` is recommended to store admin UIDs, which simplifies security rules based on document existence. **QAPs**: List operations for products are inherently secure since no filtering based on user roles is required; all products are intended to be publicly visible."
